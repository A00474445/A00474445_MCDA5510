# Git Hello Class

## Introduction
### Sameer Patel | sameer.patel@smu.ca | A00474445
#### Hey there, My Name is Sameer. I have done my Bachelors of Technology in Information Technology back in India in 2021. Right after my undergrad, I started working as a Data Scientist for RBL Bank. I have got around 2 years of experience working with Full Stack Applications and Data Science Projects. Besides Technology, I have a keen interest in sports as well.

## Summary of the topic that brought us together
### Topic - Python
#### The topic that we all clicked on was Python. We all had past experiences and projects working with Python. Compared to other programming languages (such as C, C++, Java), Python simply makes things easier, like skipping the semicolon (';') and avoiding the need for variable initialization, making troubleshooting straightforward, etc. It has a wide range of applications in web development, automation, game development, and more. The best part of the discussion was that we would prefer Python any day over any other technology.

## List each person in the group( their name, where from and why they have chosen MCDA)

### 1. Princeton Hilary Dcunha | Mangalore, India
#### Princeton has been fond of computers and technology since his childhood. He has 5.5 years of professional experience in the field of API development. Learning DevOps and Data Science are his next career enhancement goals. He has been working in the IT industry for a few years now and he wants to enhance his current knowledge in development, but along with that, he also wants to delve into the field of Data Analytics & Science. While there were many universities in Canada that offered courses in Data Analytics / Data Science, none of them seem to offer a combination of development and data analysis courses like the MSCDA program at Saint Mary's University. This was one of the major reasons why he chose MSCDA.

#### Fun Fact: Princeton had witnessed a UFO at the age of 16 while he was on a vacation in Qatar.

### 2. Pranay Malusare | Pune, India
#### Pranay has completed his Bachelors of Engineering in Information Technology. During his undergrad, he got expsoure to Data Science and Analytics through his course work and assignments, which he found interesting. This is one the major reasons why he opted for MSCDA program at Saint Mary's.

#### Fun Fact: Pranay has the expertise of cooking 6-7 cuisines.
