## Introduction
### Sameer Patel | sameer.patel@smu.ca | A00474445
#### Hey there, My Name is Sameer. I have done my Bachelors of Technology in Information Technology back in India in 2021. Right after my undergrad, I started working as a Data Scientist for RBL Bank. I have got around 2 years of experience working with Full Stack Applications and Data Science Projects. Besides Technology, I have a keen interest in sports as well.

## Summary of the Topic that brought us Together
### Topic - Python
#### The topic that we all clicked on was Python. We all had past experiences and projects working with Python. Compared to other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java, Python simply makes things easier for a developer. From a Developer's POV, Python is comparitively easier to learn, use and has a lot of community support in terms of libraries. It is also quite versatile and has a wide range of applications in Web Development, Automation, Game Development, etc. The best part of the discussion was that we would prefer Python any day over any other Technology.
