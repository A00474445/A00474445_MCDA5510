#### Hey there, My Name is Sameer. I have done my Bachelors of Technology in Information Technology back in India in 2021. Right after my undergrad, I started working as a Data Scientist for RBL Bank. I have got around 2 years of experience working with Full Stack Applications and Data Science Projects. Besides Technology, I have a keen interest in sports as well.

## Summary of the topic that brought us together
### Topic - Python
#### The topic that we all clicked on was Python. We all had past experiences and projects working with Python. Compared to other programming languages (such as C, C++, Java), Python simply makes things easier, like skipping the semicolon (';') and avoiding the need for variable initialization, making troubleshooting straightforward, etc. It has a wide range of applications in web development, automation, game development, and more. The best part of the discussion was that we would prefer Python any day over any other technology.
